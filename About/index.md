Emma is a Research Fellow at Imperial College London based in the Department of Life Sciences at [Silwood Park](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/silwood-park/). She completed her PhD in biological oceanography on plankton poo and the ocean carbon sink in 2016, from the [National Oceanography Centre, Southampton](https://www.noc.ac.uk). She then moved to Tasmania, Australia, to work as a post-doc at the [Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies](https://www.imas.utas.edu.au) at the University of Tasmania. In 2019, Emma moved back to the UK where she took up her second post-doc in ecosystem modelling at Silwood Park, Imperial College London. In July 2020 Emma started her present position at Imperial, a 4-year [Imperial College Research Fellowship](http://127.0.0.1:4000/Research/).

Emma's research focusses on how **climate change** and **fishing** impact the **ocean carbon sink**. Her focus is to work at the border of both ecology and biogeochemistry.  
  
  Key interests include:

- How fishing disturbs food webs, lower trophic levels and the ocean carbon sink 
- Role of climate change in disrupting ocean nutrients and lower trophic levels, and how this impacts whole food webs and fishery catch potential
- Emma has particular expertise in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, particularly krill!
